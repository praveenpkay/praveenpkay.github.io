"Praveen has that rare combination of curiosity and grit to persevere in adversity. His innate curiosity kept translating into actions; he quickly picked up the project's pace and made notable contributions to the delivery. 

Apart from his exceptional project deliverables over the last year, Praveen's contribution towards the entity and organizational business development initiatives are highly commendable; he brings in his domain and technical expertise when conversing with prospective clients in the Alcobev industry, realizing the organization's vision to transform from an execution partner to a consulting partner.

What stands out with Praveen is his growth mindset, charismatic spirit, and incredible self-awareness of his strengths and weaknesses. He humbly is content that he might not have all the knowledge and skills, yet he puts himself into the unknown, says yes to challenging opportunities, and embraces learning through application and experience. And with that said, I would like to wish him all the best in all his future endeavors. "

"Praveen started at LatentView Analytics as an analyst and I've been one of his immediate supervisors of the project where we were trying to solve a complex problem that demanded business context at every step; we needed to identify the right talent who was not only technically well-equipped but also comfortable working with ambiguity and asks the right questions to the stakeholders, and Praveen expertly filled in there. 

Notably, In my leave of absence, he enthusiastically jumped in on the opportunity to manage the team, organized multiple stakeholder meetings, and took critical delivery decisions. He also empowered the team to take up responsibilities and created a healthy collaborative environment. 

With his consistent performance over the last couple of evaluation cycles, LatentView even made an exception to its policies to reward him with a promotion to Senior Analyst within a year. I wish him all the very best for what it is to come. "
